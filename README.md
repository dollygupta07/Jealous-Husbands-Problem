# Jealous-Husbands-Problem

Problem statement:
Three jealous husbands and their wives need to cross a river using a single boat. At no time should any of the women be left in company with any of the men, unless her husband is present. The boat can carry up to two passengers and can not move by itself.

The code allows the user to input ANY number of couples and ANY capacity for the boat. The code finds the solution using the some search strategies and then compares the time taken by each strategy.

Supported search strategies are:
* Breadth-First Search
* Depth-First Search
* Greedy Best-First Search
* A* Search Algorithm
